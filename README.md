## What Is the StratoSoar Project?

StratoSoar is a low-power, adaptive UAV that is dropped from a weather balloon at approximately 5,000 feet, with plans to reach even higher altitudes soon. The main goal of StratoSoar is to fly to selected GPS coordinates efficiently or choose a closer, more realistic landing site without human interaction. The current aim for StratoSoar is to operate on a single 600 mAh 15 gram LiPo battery for a 10+ hour flight. 

## Now, What Is a UAV?

UAVs, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, are autonomous aircraft, usually in the form of planes or drones. They have many applications, such as [delivering medicine, food, and supplies](https://www.flyzipline.com/) to remote areas, participating in aerial combat with the military, and conducting aerial imaging.

### Common Types of UAVs Include:

- Quadcopter (typical drones)
- Fixed-wing aircraft (like StratoSoar)

## StratoSoar vs. Conventional UAVs

### Traditional UAVs Are Typically:

- Large (5-15 meter wingspan)
- Heavy (2-20 kg)
- Expensive ($10,000-10,000,000 USD)
- Closed source and propietary

### StratoSoar Aims to Overcome These Limitations With:

- Weight: less than 250 grams
- Wingspan: 80 cm
- Cost: less than $150 USD
- Open source and accesible

## What Are the Uses of StratoSoar?

I'm currently considering two main concepts: an educational kit for students and hobbyists or a platform designed to study the aerodynamics of the stratosphere, a field with limited existing resources. Additionally, I'm exploring other ideas such as reusable radiosondes, systems for remote delivery of medicine and parcels, and advanced atmospheric monitoring solutions.

<!-- ## What Includes the StratoSoar Project? What Are the Different Parts of it?

StratoSoar has many different parts, and they all combine to make this project. 

- **Code** - All of the code directory, and the programs needed to run it. These include the main `.ino`s and the accompanying `.cpp` and `.h` files, along with the test files for the IMU and GPS.
- **PCB** - The circuit board is the basis of this project, it interfaces the code with the glider. StratoSoar includes the circuit board files and the schematics and everything needed to build a PCB.
- **3D Files** - StratoSoar requires some 3D printed parts to function, but these files also serve as an interactive build guide. StratoSoar includes the 3D files needed to print parts for the glider and the 3D files to assemble the glider.
- **Media** - The images and such of StratoSoar. 
- **Cutdown Mechanism** - This is the thing that helps you release the glider from the balloon payload - or whatever you want to drop it from. This includes all of the above things but will be in a separate GitHub repository.  -->

## How Does StratoSoar Work at a High Level?

<!-- StratoSoar is attached to a weather balloon via the cutdown mechanism. Once the balloon reaches the desired altitude, the cutdown mechanism drops the glider. The glider then descends, steering its way to specified coordinates. 

StratoSoar takes pride in being highly configurable and hackable, so there are many ways you change how it comes down built into the code. 

StratoSoar uses data from an IMU that goes through a Kalman filter to receive accurate AHRS, or Attitude Heading Reference System. This can tell StratoSoar the pitch, yaw, and roll of the glider. Then, StratoSoar integrates a GPS module to get the GPS coordinates. Both the GPS and the AHRS are used to compute the azimuth to find the turning angle of the glider. The turning angle tells the glider how much it needs to turn to be facing the correct yaw that will get the glider to the target location. Additionally, an algorithm is used to get the distance between the glider location's and the target location. 

With the turning angle computed, a PID mechanism is used to control the servo attached to the rudder of the glider. This PID mechanism learn from it's mistakes and can accurately aim the glider in the correct direction. 

Additionally, the glider beacons it's location at a configurable interval with LoRa for tracking. It also allows for a camera module to be added on to take photos and video. 

The glider will fly to the selected coordinates, and depending on the user configuration, will either spiral down or release a parachute above the coordinates once it has reached them to safely descend. Additionally, if the glider is too low in altitude, prior to the flight the user can enter closer coordinates as backup landing locations.  -->

StratoSoar MK3 is an advanced autonomous glider designed to operate at high altitudes, such as those reached by weather balloons. The glider is attached to a weather balloon via a cutdown mechanism. Once the balloon reaches the desired altitude, the cutdown mechanism releases the glider, initiating its descent. The glider then navigates autonomously to specified coordinates, using a combination of sensors, advanced algorithms, and low-power electronics.

### Core Components and Functionality:

- **Autopilot System**:
    - **GPS and IMU Integration**: StratoSoar uses a custom GPS module and an IMU, both designed for low-power operation. The IMU data is processed through a Kalman filter to provide accurate Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS) data, including pitch, yaw, and roll. This information, combined with GPS coordinates, enables precise navigation.
    - **Advanced Waypoint Navigation**: The waypoint navigation system is designed for complex flight paths, incorporating advanced turning algorithms to ensure smooth and accurate direction changes.
    - **Servo Control with PID**: A PID control mechanism governs the rudderâ€™s servo, ensuring precise adjustments to the glider's course based on real-time feedback.

- **Communication and Data Logging**:
    - **LoRa Telemetry**: The glider continuously beacons its location via LoRa communication, which includes forward error correction for reliable data transmission. This allows for real-time tracking and data collection.
    - **Data Logging**: Critical flight data, including sensor readings and GPS coordinates, are logged using a combination of SD card and EEPROM storage, optimized for low power consumption.
    - **Camera**: If configured, the glider uses a custom designed camera module to take photos at specific coordinates or record the entire flight.  

- **Modularity and Customization**:
    - **Hackability**: StratoSoar is designed to be highly configurable and hackable. Users can customize its descent strategy, whether by spiral descent, parachute deployment, or alternative landing locations. The codebase is modular, allowing for easy modifications or the addition of new features.
    - **Camera Module**: An optional low-power camera module can be added to capture photos or video during the flight, with Python scripts available for post-processing the footage.

- **Ground Station and Data Handling**:
    - **Ground Station**: The ground station, built on an ESP32 platform, receives telemetry data from the glider via LoRa. It logs this data locally and communicates with a server using HTTP requests. A Flask-based uploader script then transfers the data to SondeHub for analysis and storage.

- **PCB Design**:
    - **StratoSoar MK3 PCB**: The main PCB, optimized for power efficiency, size, and cost, integrates over 100 components, managing the various systems onboard.
    - **Additional PCBs**: Supporting PCBs, such as those for the GPS module, LoRa communication, camera, and IMU, are designed for specific tasks, enhancing the glider's overall functionality.

### Operation and Recovery:

Upon release from the weather balloon, StratoSoar begins its guided descent following waypoints or single target coordinate. It calculates the optimal flight path using its GPS and AHRS data, making real-time adjustments to its trajectory through the PID-controlled servo system. Depending on user configurations, the glider can either glide smoothly to the target coordinates, initiate a spiral descent, or deploy a parachute for a safe landing.

If the glider's altitude drops below a certain threshold, backup landing coordinates can be used to ensure a safe recovery. Throughout the flight, the gliderâ€™s location is continuously transmitted, allowing for easy tracking and recovery.

## A Quick Note on MK1, MK2, Naming, and Revisions

StratoSoar MK1 was the precursor and the spark to StratoSoar MK2. StratoSoar MK1 was officially developed from October 1st to July 30th, although StratoSoar MK2 was unofficially being worked on in the months of March through June. StratoSoar MK1 failed to fly autonomously, and it also failed to release from the balloon. Major upgrades have been made since then.

StratoSoar MK2 officially started on October 1st, and will end has now ended. It was a success. 

StratoSoar MK3 officially started on June 1st, and will end in quite some time when I launch it from a weather balloon. A new major revision (eg. MK4) will come out every time when I release the glider from the balloon in the Summer. After the Summer, work on the next revision begins, with many updates and new features. 

<!-- A new sub-revision (for lack of better word) comes out every time I make a new PCB. For example, my first version of my PCB was MK2.0. At the time of writing, the current version of StratoSoar is MK2.1. A new version of 3D model is denoted by the Rev number. Rev starts at 0. 0 and 1 are not shown in this repo because they didn't turn out very good. The physical gliders are denoted by the 3D model number. Sometimes a small change is made with glider so the name of the glider is Rev x.x, for example. Sometimes the same happens with the 3D model, again it would be x.x. To put this in practice, the final glider may be MK2.5 Rev 7.3.1. The code has no version history in the way the 3D models and the PCB do. -->

Also, I use "we" a lot in this writing. This usually refers to myself or this project, but it also refers to my small team over at New England Weather Balloon Society.

One last thing. When I refer to StratoSoar, I am referring to the project as a whole, but more specifically, the most recent version. 

<!-- ## Watch my Talk About StratoSoar MK2 The North East HamXpo! -->

## Is This Legal?
Yes! Since the glider is unpowered, and during flight you have no control of where the glider goes, it qualifies as a free flight glider. Free flight gliders have very little regulations. You can think of them as a paper airplane. 

## Can I Buy a Kit or a Complete Product?

Currently, StratoSoar is not available to purchase online as a kit or complete product. We have plans in the next few years to release a kit for schools, education centers, hobbyists and a complete product for industry at an affordable price. You are welcome to make one in the mean time!

## How Can I Make One? Are There Docs?

One of the goals of StratoSoar was to make an affordable and open source system for anyone to perform stratospheric research, so all the files are available for free. This means that you can construct StratoSoar from scratch. **A guide to do this will be available soon.**

<!-- It is still in the works, but you can check out `DOCS.md` under the `Docs` folder.**  -->
