# This is for Hack Club Arcade

This is a glider that is very easy to manufacture. You simply cut it out with a laser, plotter, CNC, or another tool and fold it up. It is designed to be outfitted with my custom electronics and to be used in disaster releif. My goal is for the entire bundle to be less than $75 to make it open to everyone.

Swept wings decrease drag but also reduce lift and are beneficial near supersonic speeds. They act like a lever, helping balance the center of gravity (CG) and provide better leverage for the plane’s elevons.

However, swept wings can cause yaw and roll cycles due to uneven lift, leading to instability. Wing fences and tip fins improve stability by mitigating turbulence and must be positioned behind the CG to maintain positive stability. Tip fins also enhance yaw stability by preventing air from below the plane from causing additional drag.

The videos explain the concepts of center of gravity (CG) and center of pressure (CP). CG is fixed, but CP changes with the angle of attack, which can cause instability. On conventional aircraft, tails provide a downward force to balance CG and CP. It’s crucial to place the CG far in front of the CP for stability, similar to a dart’s design.

Reflex, the upturned trailing edge, acts like a tail for stability but decreases efficiency. Symmetrical airfoils are used for better stability and to reduce the need for reflex.

So to summarize my last session, you can cut foam board with a 5 watt laser diode only if the foam board is black because of the wavelengths interfering. Black foam board is about 4.50 per sheet, so not too expensive. I may go this route.

I watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5YABSqPOY0. It was very helpful for me to understand cutting cardbaord on a laser diode. It seems to work much better than a high power CO2 laser, like a Glowforge. It does take some time, though. The person had the speed at 30 mm/s and 40 PASSES, which is a lot of passes. If I get a laser, I may experiment with fewer passes and decreased speed to do it quicker. This seems like the best solution for manufacturing cardboard sheets, seeing as diode lasers are much larger than CO2 lasers for much cheaper. I might buy one, we’ll see.

So I took a break to research laser cutter safety. They aren’t very safe and there’s no way my parents are letting me get one even if I pay for it. This is sad because they are perfect for my needs. However, my maker space has one but the working space of it is very limiting. Because of this I will research alternate routes.

More research to report! There aren’t any machines that can cut cardboard as well as a laser. However, a Cricut can cut cardboard quite well. The only problem with the Cricut is that they have a maximum width of 12 inches. That isn’t enough. I shall continue researching until I find a way to cut this cardboard. I may look into that needle cutter again because of how cheap and easy to use it is. It is also safe to use which is nice. (edited) 

I watched this video, it wasn’t very helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N42lrWzGQjw. I also watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kho1yvjRKxQ, and it shows how CNCs can cut cardboard quite well. Unfortunately, CNCs are big and expensive and I don’t have one and neither does my maker space. I guess I need to build one! (edited) 

Did more research and I found out that I cannot cut foam core with my hot wire CNC cutter. I think the only option left now is to adapt my CNC foam cutter to use a needle cutter or a drag cutter. I will research both.

So, yes it is possible to make a CNC drag cutter. This seems really cool. The thing I’m wary about though is if my CNC foam cutter can hold all the heavy stuff to control the drag cutter.

I plan to research laser cutters, specifically for cutting foam and cardboard. Initially, it seems that a diode laser might be suitable for cutting foam board, but there are other considerations. For instance, some people suggest using a CO2 laser, which is much more expensive, around $3,000, compared to diode lasers, which cost around $200.

According to Reddit, the type of foam board matters significantly. They recommend using foam board with a cardboard backing, known as art board. Additionally, it's crucial to have an air assist feature to blow away flames that may arise during cutting, as some foam materials are prone to catching fire. Good ventilation or wearing a respirator is also essential for safety.

White foam doesn't work well with lasers because it reflects all colors. For such materials, a special foam cutter or a CO2 laser is required. I came across a discussion about a needle cutter on the LightBurn Software forum. The needle cutter operates by moving a needle up and down rapidly, penetrating the foam board to make precise cuts. However, constructing a needle cutter seems quite labor-intensive.

Given these insights, it's clear that diode lasers are not suitable for cutting certain types of foam due to their different wavelengths.
