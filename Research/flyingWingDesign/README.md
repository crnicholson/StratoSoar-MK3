Swept wings decrease drag but also reduce lift and are beneficial near supersonic speeds. They act like a lever, helping balance the center of gravity (CG) and provide better leverage for the plane's elevons.

However, swept wings can cause yaw and roll cycles due to uneven lift, leading to instability. Wing fences and tip fins improve stability by mitigating turbulence and must be positioned behind the CG to maintain positive stability. Tip fins also enhance yaw stability by preventing air from below the plane from causing additional drag.

The videos explain the concepts of center of gravity (CG) and center of pressure (CP). CG is fixed, but CP changes with the angle of attack, which can cause instability. On conventional aircraft, tails provide a downward force to balance CG and CP. It's crucial to place the CG far in front of the CP for stability, similar to a dart's design.

Reflex, the upturned trailing edge, acts like a tail for stability but decreases efficiency. Symmetrical airfoils are used for better stability and to reduce the need for reflex.
