Note: being lazy with the spelling, sorry! :)

will research lasercutters

i need to laser cut foam and cardboard

i also need to research flying wings bc I have no clue about their aerodynamics

i’ll document my findings in a readme file

seems like a diode laser is the best for cutting foam board

okay, some people are saying co2 laser

co2 lasers are like 3,00 dolla though

and diode lasers are only $200

reddit also says that the foam board matters

they say to get the foam board that has a cardboard backing - called art oard

and you need air assist to blow away the flames if they show up - some foam makes flames

they also recommend having good ventilation or wearing a respirator

oh, interesting

white foam doesn’t work very well because it reflects all color

you apparently need a special foam cutter or a co2 laser

i shall research this needle cutter

https://forum.lightburnsoftware.com/t/cutting-dollar-tree-foam-board/97158

so the needle cutter is similar to blot which is pretty rad

just a bit bigger

so it works by having a needle go up and down really really quickly

it basically penetrates the foam board and makes a fairly precise cut

it seems like it would be too much work to make though

so I’m going to research further into lasers

okay, diode lasers can’t do it! interesting! it’s mainly bc of the different wavelength

you need a co2 laser

which are super expensive.
