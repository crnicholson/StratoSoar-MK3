So to summarize my last session, you can cut foam board with a 5 watt laser diode only if the foam board is black because of the wavelengths interfering. Black foam board is about 4.50 per sheet, so not too expensive. I may go this route.

I watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5YABSqPOY0. It was very helpful for me to understand cutting cardbaord on a laser diode. It seems to work much better than a high power CO2 laser, like a Glowforge. It does take some time, though. The person had the speed at 30 mm/s and 40 PASSES, which is a lot of passes. If I get a laser, I may experiment with fewer passes and decreased speed to do it quicker. This seems like the best solution for manufacturing cardboard sheets, seeing as diode lasers are much larger than CO2 lasers for much cheaper. I might buy one, we’ll see.

So I took a break to research laser cutter safety. They aren’t very safe and there’s no way my parents are letting me get one even if I pay for it. This is sad because they are perfect for my needs. However, my maker space has one but the working space of it is very limiting. Because of this I will research alternate routes.

More research to report! There aren’t any machines that can cut cardboard as well as a laser. However, a Cricut can cut cardboard quite well. The only problem with the Cricut is that they have a maximum width of 12 inches. That isn’t enough. I shall continue researching until I find a way to cut this cardboard. I may look into that needle cutter again because of how cheap and easy to use it is. It is also safe to use which is nice. (edited) 

I watched this video, it wasn’t very helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N42lrWzGQjw. I also watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kho1yvjRKxQ, and it shows how CNCs can cut cardboard quite well. Unfortunately, CNCs are big and expensive and I don’t have one and neither does my maker space. I guess I need to build one! (edited) 

Did more research and I found out that I cannot cut foam core with my hot wire CNC cutter. I think the only option left now is to adapt my CNC foam cutter to use a needle cutter or a drag cutter. I will research both.

So, yes it is possible to make a CNC drag cutter. This seems really cool. The thing I’m wary about though is if my CNC foam cutter can hold all the heavy stuff to control the drag cutter.

Note: being lazy with the spelling, sorry! :)

will research lasercutters

i need to laser cut foam and cardboard

i also need to research flying wings bc I have no clue about their aerodynamics

i’ll document my findings in a readme file

seems like a diode laser is the best for cutting foam board

okay, some people are saying co2 laser

co2 lasers are like 3,00 dolla though

and diode lasers are only $200

reddit also says that the foam board matters

they say to get the foam board that has a cardboard backing - called art oard

and you need air assist to blow away the flames if they show up - some foam makes flames

they also recommend having good ventilation or wearing a respirator

oh, interesting

white foam doesn’t work very well because it reflects all color

you apparently need a special foam cutter or a co2 laser

i shall research this needle cutter

https://forum.lightburnsoftware.com/t/cutting-dollar-tree-foam-board/97158

so the needle cutter is similar to blot which is pretty rad

just a bit bigger

so it works by having a needle go up and down really really quickly

it basically penetrates the foam board and makes a fairly precise cut

it seems like it would be too much work to make though

so I’m going to research further into lasers

okay, diode lasers can’t do it! interesting! it’s mainly bc of the different wavelength

you need a co2 laser

which are super expensive.
